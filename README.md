# Internet Draft draft-jones-dkim-key-wrapper

Proposing a way to package key information in order to simplify the
exchange and provisioning of DKIM key data. The primary use case is
eliminating errors when publishing public DKIM key records in the DNS,
but the proposal tries to cover private key handling, key archiving,
and any other reasonable functions.

It is intended to reduce errors by facilitating automated processing,
particularly when inexperienced parties are asked to create DKIM
public key records in the DNS.
